Kayo (either as a default changeable name or a mandatory one), wakes up in a locker with no memory of how she got there. When leaving, she’s found by four girls who claim to be her classmates and friends. After returning home for the day, being escorted home by the group, she returns to school the next day. 

The rest goes on as normal. She remembers some things over time about her daily life, but can’t remember anything about the day of the incident, which no one else seems to remember or discuss. So, she continues hanging around her friends as normal, which is the bulk of the story taking place over a week or two. 

As the story progresses, more and more memories of the incident appear through visions around the school and of the characters. Depending on when the player notices these anomalies, different endings are met, leading to either the deaths of the girls you hang around or the player’s death. 

The earlier you find it, the better the ending (in the player’s best interest) with a secret ending being achieved if you find the first occurring anomaly on day one. 

  
  

**Summary of the events preceding the game:** 

The five had been abducted by one of the science teacher’s in the school, most after school one day, and were locked in the basement. Motives for the teacher’s actions haven’t been fleshed out yet. 

While trying to attack the teacher, Kayo is disabled and is either entirely unconscious or just enough to be able to witness the attack made after that murder the teacher (more to justify why they’d want to kill her later on for having witnessed the crime), leaving the other four to finish off the job. He ends up dying from the injuries, and not wanting anyone to find out what they did, the group finds the materials to cut the teacher to pieces, fit him into a bag, and clean up afterwards, which leaves a strong sterile smell in the basement. 

They opt to drop the body into a reservoir where the school supplies the water for the sprinkler system. After the evidence had been dealt with, before they could get back to the basement to find the only other person related to the crime, but before they could they are found by another teacher who sends them home, leaving Kayo inside the basement. 

The next day, the sprinklers are set off, which due to the body having been dumped in the reservoir, is now acidic, leading to either major injuries or death in some cases, but mostly the destruction of school property,  desks, damaged flooring, all that stuff.
