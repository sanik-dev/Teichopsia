# Maybe I should find a way out of here first
## [Touch Knees]
### No wonder my legs hurt so much. That's definitely a bruise... Probably a scrap too. I should disinfect that, huh...
## [Touch Broom]

### Is [Touch Door] true?

#### [Yes] It’s jabbing my leg a bit, I think it’s a broom or something. It’s pressing against the door slightly, maybe I could pry the door open...

#### [No] It’s jabbing my leg a bit, I think it’s a broom or something. I'd use it to shove the door open, but I think my legs would do a far better job.
## [Touch Door]

### Seems like a door but it's jammed...  There's a small gap in the bottom if I push but there's no way I'm fitting in there.

## [Touch Notes]

### This must be a little reminder note, I can’t read it at all. # Maybe the writer will come back soon?

#### Take it with me?

##### [Yes] +1 Unread Note
##### [No] Better not mess with fate
