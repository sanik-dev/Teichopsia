# **Potential Ideas:** 

- Motivation to keep MC alive is the girls don’t know the mystery behind the sprinkler incident. 

-  MC has 3 options for escape at the beginning of the game, letting a timer for the escape run out and being saved by the 4 girls. Escaping only to have a short window of time to spot an obvious anomaly before being found by the girls. And foregoing escape to discover more about the murder, leading to an alternate timeline. 

- The teacher has chemicals, like chloroform, on his person, and because the girls dismembered him with his clothes intact, they also got into the water supply. 

- The MC lives alone, explaining why no parents were worried about her, and for one reason or another is not knowledgeable when it comes to current news. This leaves only the school as a source of information, which the 4 girls actively keep her away from to keep her memories a mystery. Teachers will also quell any talk on the incident for the schools image, which helps this.

- The reservoir is right below the science lab, which is on the second floor of the school. 

- Anomalies, and how many the player clicks on throughout the route, lead to a point total which is later checked at a checkpoint within the story. If the player fails to meet the point total at critical moments in the story, she can meet a death ending.

- Players are probed by the characters about the incident throughout the story, which they do to attempt to clear their name in the eyes of the MC while also trying to see if she was the cause for the sprinkler incident, which they believe her to be. Stuff like “I can’t believe the teacher would dump chemicals in the reservoir!” in order to probe information out of the MC and gauge how much she remembers about the acid rain and murder. 

- The girls explain the MC being locked in the locker as her having hidden from the sprinklers, however it doesn’t explain how she got locked in. At this point an anomaly will appear (currently thinking it’ll be a suspicious puddle on the floor, an ampule the teacher had smashed after being hit by the chair). 

- Anomalies are both scripted, linked to major plot events or dialogue, and random throughout the day, with set items about to be classed as anomalies that can be randomly changed with a limit to how many times per day.
