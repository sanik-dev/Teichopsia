# Teichopsia

What appears to be reality is distorted by subtle changes only the discerning eye can catch. The protagonist, a young high school student,
finds herself living what seems to be an ordinary life. With every sunrise, she attends school, chats with her friends, and engages in
everyday activities. Yet, with each passing day, minor details around her start to deform.
At first glance, all is as it should be. A sliding door here, a classroom desk there, and the unchanging tick-tock of the school's hallway clock.
Yet, if you're perceptive enough, you'll begin to notice minute changes. A door operating just slightly off its track, a clock's rhythm barely
missing a beat. And as these subtle oddities pile up, our protagonist grapples with mysterious migraines and fleeting visual disturbances -
manifestations of teichopsia.

Your role, while seemingly benign, is to guide this young student. Your decisions, while appearing ordinary, hold the power to subtly shift the
reality around her. But tread lightly. As the protagonist's awareness grows, she begins to question the world, her friends, and even the
existence of an external influence: You.
